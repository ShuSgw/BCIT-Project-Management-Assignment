                    <p>Trend prediction is always difficult: seeing into the future of web development is no different. If you
                        go back through digital trend forecasts of the past decade and you find many ‘dead-certain’ predictions
                        that didn’t pan out:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Facebook would collapse after termite activity by scores of micro social media platforms</li>
                        <li>Apple TV would crush all in its path</li>
                        <li>Google, Bing and … Wolfram Alpha would smash into each other in some sort of search titanomachia</li>
                        <li> Printing would become obsolete and no new books, newspapers or paper-based advertising collateral
                            would be required.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Some of those might still come true, others are cringe-inducing. Look at widespread mobile internet. It was forecast many
                        times over many years, and then it happened. Looking back, it seems so sudden now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With it, mobile internet brought many second-order changes in web development best-practice. Take responsive web design.
                        When the web was desk-bound and 17 inches was considered a big monitor, web development and design
                        companies didn’t really push responsivity because it didn’t really matter. Now people regularly use
                        websites and services on screens ranging from the 1.5-inches on a smartwatch to the 110-inches of
                        a pricey TV. Just before it started to matter the industry saw this need coming and did something
                        about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re a business owner wanting to improve your web presence or starting a whole new venture and looking for platforms
                        that’ll stand the test of time, you’ll want to know the direction things are going.

                        No, not Skynet or The Matrix, we are simply talking about computers that respond to their environment in a proactive way.
                        We are already seeing it in software applications that can observe and optimise particular loops
                        in their own performance.

                    <h2>2. Internet of things</h2>
                    <span>2</span>
                    <p>
                        Like AI, the internet of things (IoT) is another trend in the future of web development that has been a slow-burner that
                        is now increasing in temperature. What IoT is really about is bringing connectivity to the everyday
                        objects around us to enable us to know more about them and therefore get more utility from them.
                        The reason this can now happen in a big way is cloud connectivity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can already see IoT happening with exercise trackers. For example, the fitness trackers of navigation services giant
                        Garmin can connect physical activity data to health optimisation platforms. Now, by also tracking
                        biometrics, sleep cycles and nutrition, it can optimise how your body operates. It can even reveal
                        food allergies by cross-referencing meal times and heart rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, cloud-connected cars already report performance and maintenance diagnostics back to service centres. Soon cars
                        will also connect to the other vehicles around them. Imagine a car that can hit a pothole and then
                        automatically warn all the vehicles following to get their shock absorbers ready for the bump
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our prediction: IoT is already entrenched in specialised applications, we think it will cross completely into the mainstream
                        between 2025 and 2030.

                    <span>3</span>
                    <p>
                        The languages behind the software running all the cool new things already exist. In fact, they are already several software
                        generations old. Python, which dates from 1991, is flexible, resilient and, crucially, a scalable
                        high-level programming language that can make it all happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like the English language’s role in international business, Python is becoming the lingua franca of web development. Like
                        English, it’s convenient, fast and adaptable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facebook, NASA, Google, Youtube all use Python extensively. Further, it is great for AI, machine learning, API integration
                        and rapid development - all trends of themselves. If Java is the dying star in your local web development
                        and design company, then across the board, Python’s is going interstellar. Check out our other post
                        on 8 Reasons To Create Websites with Python for more resources on why it is growing quickly.

                    <p>
                        Our prediction: Python will be the number 1 web development language by 2020.

                            that it is impossible, he is very probably wrong.”

                        How will that hold for the future of web development? At the moment, our corporate strategy is betting our business on these
                        trends. However, we’re not elderly, not scientists and we’re still working on the distinguished.
