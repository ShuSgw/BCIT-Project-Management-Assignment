                    <h1>What is Full Stack Web Design?</h1>
                    <p>In the “old” days, it was fairly straightforward. There was very clear separation between the design
                        and development groups, with very few people doing both. Now though, it’s fairly uncommon to find
                        a web designer that doesn’t also do some sort of development or UX work as well. With many of us
                        branching into more skills within our industry, we’re becoming increasingly more resourceful. The
                        problem is that now a “web designer” could mean someone who only does design, does design and some
                        code, or may even handle the full design to development process! We’ve become an industry of renaissance
                        workers not content with learning just what we need to get by, and that’s a great thing.

                    <h3>What is a full-stack designer?</h3>

                    <p> Enter the full-stack designer. Being full-stack simply refers to someone who is cross-disciplinary and
                        able to take a project through to completion. In this case, it’s referring to an individual who has
                        the skills to carry a project through the first few major project phases. Full-stack developers have
                        been around for years now, handling everything from front-end dev, back-end dev, back-end server
                        management, and more. I know what you’re thinking: “Great, another marketing phrase is just what
                        this industry needs!” But I can assure you this one is sticking around, and it has more value than
                        a hip moniker. Take a look at a large selection of job openings and you’ll undoubtedly find many
                        “Product Designer” and “Full-Stack Designer” listings.</p>

                    <h3>Fringe benefits of being full-stack</h3>
                    <p>Web design uses many of the same key visual elements as all types of design such as:</p>
                    <p>The benefits of expanding our skill sets are quite nice. Full-stack designers often end up with a more
                        thorough understanding of their work, making it more consistent from research to production phases.
                        Knowing the limitations and what to expect in development, while planning UX/UI wireframes, can keep
                        concepts realistic. So not only are full-stack designers more knowledgeable about what can and cannot
                        work elegantly in design, but they also have more realistic expectations before we even start pushing
                        pixels or coding. Having an expansive skill set is exceedingly beneficial to the people who employ
                        us as well! Our employers are afforded a team member who can jump in and help even outside their
                        area of focus. This means keeping teams lean and diversified with less people, and everyone having
                        more of a grasp of the whole-picture. There are countless good qualities about having such an expansive
                        skill set, but the most important being you just learn more. Even having a basic foundation in development
                        or another skill can increase the likelihood of learning more in that area. With that small nugget
                        of knowledge already in place, pursuing further education is made easier as the content is already
                        slightly more relatable. So next time you see that article about the skill you’ve been meaning to
                        learn for ages, just go for it. You don’t have to be an expert by the end of it, you just have to
                        remember enough to make next time easier.

                    <h3>The pitfalls of expansive skill sets</h3>
                    <p>It’s taken us quite a while to even get where we are today in terms of education. Being able to instantly
                        look something up and “accidentally” spend the next four hours learning about it is the fantastic
                        future we live in. But, when you have dozens of technologies, practices, and skills to keep up to
                        date, that process can easily result in a long “to-read” list. With so much to keep up with, it’s
                        easy to simply not have enough time. That doesn’t mean we lose lose the skill altogether, it merely
                        means that skill isn’t one of our highlights, so to speak. It’s very common that someone could be
                        an expert with CSS/HTML, yet only have a basic working knowledge of JavaScript. It’s not only hard
                        to keep up with everything, but it’s also hard to pinpoint which technologies to invest our time
                        with as well. With the industry growing at such a fast rate, there’s a new language, library, and
                        use pattern by the end of each day. Anyone remember the days of jQuery vs MooTools vs JavaScript
                        debates? Pinpointing which skills to learn, and which are merely passing fads can easily make or
                        break a time investment. Employers aren’t exempt from these pitfalls either. Being a much more skilled
                        team member typically comes along with a higher salary. While most full-stack designers won’t cost
                        the same as multiple designers and developers, they certainly cost a premium to be just as skillful.</p>

                    <h3>Why are full-stack designers important?
                    </h3>
                    <p>Becoming a full-stack anything is special in and of itself. It’s investing quite a lot of time and effort
                        into oneself professionally, most often outside the workplace. So what makes full-stack designers
                        so important? Primarily, it’s the skills in their spectrum. Typically, designers are the ones organizing
                        research, creating wireframes, checking out UX patterns, organizing UI design, and generally making
                        sure we aren’t ending up with stunningly beautiful websites and apps that simply don’t have a purpose.
                        "Being more than just a cog in the machine is what being full-stack is all about" Being more than
                        just a cog in the machine is what being full-stack is all about. When it comes to design, that means
                        defining what a project’s purpose and goals are in the planning phases while also keeping design
                        and development limitations and goals in mind. Someone who can thoroughly manage and understand a
                        project from its conception all the way to its first steps into development makes for a much more
                        consistent experience. Some of the best websites, apps, and even products you’ve used were likely
                        created or overseen by a manager with such a vast skill set to ensure such high quality.</p>
