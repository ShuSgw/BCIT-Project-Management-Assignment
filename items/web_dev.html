                    <p>
                        Web Development is somewhat a vague term used to describe the building or maintaining of web sites hosted on the internet.
                        I use the word ‘vague' because there's so many programming languages, frameworks and tools that are
                        used for Web Development. Web Development could refer to a single web page built with HTML and CSS
                        that might contain a couple hundred lines of code. Or on the other end of the spectrum it could refer
                        to a website like Facebook that supposedly contains around 60 million lines of code, See reference:
                        How Many Lines of Code.

                    <h2>What is web Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        Web development itself and how it is done has changed greatly over the years, but one thing has remained the same: web development
                        is about creating applications which run in a web browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of those applications have most of their logic living on a web server which renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create
                        an application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other applications only utilize the server to create their initial state, download the logic to run the application, and
                        then use the server only to retrieve and store data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless, though, of how web development is done, the basic technologies are the same: HTML, JavaScript, CSS —and a large
                        amount of patience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Web developers today utilize about every major programming language to create web applications. To name a few of the most
                        popular web development languages in no particular order:
