                <p>
                    Being able to quickly and efficiently one-line our skills and the focus of our professional life has a lot of value. The
                    title that we use can effectively tell others what we do, and where our career is heading. Despite this
                    importance, titles are something many of us have trouble with.

                        designers who understand code, produce more realistic mockups

                <p>
                    It’s definitely hard to find a title that clearly explains our skills and limitations as a professional. Understanding the
                    full-stack terminology isn’t only beneficial to help give ourselves a title though. It’s also immensely
                    valuable to become that team member who can step in at any phase of a project to help out. Or just to
                    use the skills in planning ahead of what our main job focus may be (It’s common knowledge that designers
                    who understand code, produce more realistic mockups). So, how do we get started?

                        “Web designer” could mean someone who only does design, does design and some code, or may even handle the full design to
                        development process!
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter the full-stack designer. Being full-stack simply refers to someone who is cross-disciplinary and able to take a project
                    through to completion. In this case, it’s referring to an individual who has the skills to carry a project
                    through the first few major project phases. Full-stack developers have been around for years now, handling
                    everything from front-end dev, back-end dev, back-end server management, and more. I know what you’re
                    thinking: “Great, another marketing phrase is just what this industry needs!” But I can assure you this
                    one is sticking around, and it has more value than a hip moniker. Take a look at a large selection of
                    job openings and you’ll undoubtedly find many “Product Designer” and “Full-Stack Designer” listings.

                <h2>Fringe benefits of being full-stack</h2>
                <p>
                    The benefits of expanding our skill sets are quite nice. Full-stack designers often end up with a more thorough understanding
                    of their work, making it more consistent from research to production phases. Knowing the limitations
                    and what to expect in development, while planning UX/UI wireframes, can keep concepts realistic. So not
                    only are full-stack designers more knowledgeable about what can and cannot work elegantly in design,
                    but they also have more realistic expectations before we even start pushing pixels or coding. Having
                    an expansive skill set is exceedingly beneficial to the people who employ us as well! Our employers are
                    afforded a team member who can jump in and help even outside their area of focus. This means keeping
                    teams lean and diversified with less people, and everyone having more of a grasp of the whole-picture.
                    There are countless good qualities about having such an expansive skill set, but the most important being
                    you just learn more. Even having a basic foundation in development or another skill can increase the
                    likelihood of learning more in that area. With that small nugget of knowledge already in place, pursuing
                    further education is made easier as the content is already slightly more relatable. So next time you
                    see that article about the skill you’ve been meaning to learn for ages, just go for it. You don’t have
                    to be an expert by the end of it, you just have to remember enough to make next time easier.

                <h2>The pitfalls of expansive skill sets</h2>
                <p>It’s taken us quite a while to even get where we are today in terms of education. Being able to instantly
                    look something up and “accidentally” spend the next four hours learning about it is the fantastic future
                    we live in. But, when you have dozens of technologies, practices, and skills to keep up to date, that
                    process can easily result in a long “to-read” list. With so much to keep up with, it’s easy to simply
                    not have enough time. That doesn’t mean we lose lose the skill altogether, it merely means that skill
                    isn’t one of our highlights, so to speak. It’s very common that someone could be an expert with CSS/HTML,
                    yet only have a basic working knowledge of JavaScript. It’s not only hard to keep up with everything,
                    but it’s also hard to pinpoint which technologies to invest our time with as well. With the industry
                    growing at such a fast rate, there’s a new language, library, and use pattern by the end of each day.
                    Anyone remember the days of jQuery vs MooTools vs JavaScript debates? Pinpointing which skills to learn,
                    and which are merely passing fads can easily make or break a time investment. Employers aren’t exempt
                    from these pitfalls either. Being a much more skilled team member typically comes along with a higher
                    salary. While most full-stack designers won’t cost the same as multiple designers and developers, they
                    certainly cost a premium to be just as skillful.</p>

                <h2>Why are full-stack designers important?</h2>
                <p>Becoming a full-stack anything is special in and of itself. It’s investing quite a lot of time and effort
                    into oneself professionally, most often outside the workplace. So what makes full-stack designers so
                    important? Primarily, it’s the skills in their spectrum. Typically, designers are the ones organizing
                    research, creating wireframes, checking out UX patterns, organizing UI design, and generally making sure
                    we aren’t ending up with stunningly beautiful websites and apps that simply don’t have a purpose.

                </p>
                <p>Being more than just a cog in the machine is what being full-stack is all about. When it comes to design,
                    that means defining what a project’s purpose and goals are in the planning phases while also keeping
                    design and development limitations and goals in mind. Someone who can thoroughly manage and understand
                    a project from its conception all the way to its first steps into development makes for a much more consistent
                    experience. Some of the best websites, apps, and even products you’ve used were likely created or overseen
                    by a manager with such a vast skill set to ensure such high quality.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Titles are important, there’s no doubt about it. But only because they represent (albeit, poorly) the skills
                    we possess. When it comes down to it, investing the time to further ourselves professionally by expanding
                    those skills only benefits everyone involved. Continued education has always been a part of our fast
                    paced industry, so let’s use that to our advantage and become the best full-stack workers out there.</p>
