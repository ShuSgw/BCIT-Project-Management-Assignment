                    <p>
                        I don’t know about you, but for me, dabbling in anything related to web design can be both extremely fun and extremely frustrating.
                        And to find yourself in more of the former than the latter, you need to have the right tools at your
                        disposal. Hence, working with the best web design software available. And I know it might sound simple,
                        maybe even trivial, but having the right software at hand can really enable you to do a day’s worth
                        of work in just an hour or so. But it also goes the other way around … bad software = bad work efficiency.

                    <p>
                        Sorry. I know that I might have just spent a couple of minutes telling you how Photoshop is not the be-all end-all of web
                        design, but hey, I want to keep this list complete, so I just have to mention Photoshop at no.1,
                        purely due to its unquestionable position as the market leader among best web design software. So
                        about Photoshop itself: In a sentence, it’s an extremely versatile tool that can be used to work
                        on any kind of design project, not just web design. Its primary purpose is to help you work with
                        raster graphics (click here for more info on what that means). For example, every picture taken by
                        your phone camera is then saved as a raster graphic. With Photoshop, you can adjust any aspect of
                        an image or a graphic (including the colors, saturation, blurs, sharpness, and so on), and you can
                        also create completely custom graphics from scratch (for example, website layouts and visualizations).
                        You can combine multiple images as part of one project, and make sure that they all fit together
                        by using various filters or performing some transformations. When you first open Photoshop, you get
                        a blank canvas onto which you can start placing various elements (in layers), and adjust them one
                        by one until you have your final effect. Photoshop itself is a very manual tool, so to speak. I mean,
                        it requires you to know exactly what you want to do and what sort of result you want to achieve.
                        For that, it also requires some design skill and knowledge to really be able to take full advantage
                        of it. Either way, it’s still a great piece of software to have in your toolbox, just because there’s
                        simply no web design task that can’t be done with Photoshop. You can get Photoshop either as part
                        of Adobe’s monthly subscription plan – Adobe Creative Cloud – starting at $19.99 a month, or you
                        can get it for a one-time fee of $699 (visit a local store). Available for Windows and Mac.

                    <p>
                        Launched in 2009, this tool has quickly found its spot among the best web design software out there. It’s somewhat similar
                        to Photoshop, but not quite. I mean, where Photoshop can be used to work on any sort of a design
                        project, Sketch is purely web-design-centered, and it shows. The great thing about it is that all
                        of the features have been built from the ground up to really address the needs of a web design project.
                        The way the interface itself works, and the way all the toolbars and functions are laid out makes
                        working with Sketch very intuitive and much easier to grasp than Photoshop. More so, Sketch works
                        with vector graphics, which enables you to re-scale the piece you’re working on freely, without loosing
                        any of its visual quality (like you do with raster graphics). Last but not least, you can also take
                        advantage of the mirroring feature, which allows you to preview your work on any mobile device integrated
                        with your main Sketch install. In short, highly optimized tool, great for web design, much easier
                        to use than Photoshop. The only downside to Sketch is that it’s available on Mac only. If you want
                        something for Win, you can check out:

                    <p>
                        Balsamiq fills an interesting niche when it comes to best web design software. For example, if you want to build a complete
                        web design, you can use Sketch or Photoshop for that. If you then want to turn that design into a
                        live website, WordPress will handle the task perfectly. But what if you’re at an earlier stage? For
                        example, you’re brainstorming with a team or even on your own, and you simply want to come up with
                        a good layout that would be a nice starting point for further work. This is where wireframing comes
                        into play. Balsamiq is one of the best wireframing tools around. It’s easy to use, gives you a nice
                        canvas to fill, along with all the common website structure elements you could need. Balsamiq is
                        available for Mac and Windows, and the single user license is $89.

                        plugins. In a sentence, those plugins easily put WordPress on par with other best web design software.
                        Some of the popular such plugins include MotoPress (premium) and Elementor (free).
