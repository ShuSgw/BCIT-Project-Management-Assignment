                <p>
                    Web front-end development tools have come a long way in just a few short years. Thanks to this progress, we can harness the
                    power of highly tested libraries to improve our workflow and benefit from greater possibilities when
                    it comes to responsive design. Not only that, we can build things together thanks to ever-improving version
                    control systems. From browser add-ons and plugins, to processors that streamline your code, there have
                    never been more possibilities for creating awesome web applications.

                <h2>7 Great Web Development Tools</h2>

                <h3>1. Sublime Text</h3>
                <span>1</span>
                <p>
                    Let’s start with the basics: a first-rate code editor – one that features a well-designed, super efficient, and ultra speedy
                    user interface. There are several that do this well, but arguably the best (and most popular) is Sublime
                    Text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artfully run by a one-man development team, the secret to Sublime’s success lies in the program’s vast array of keyboard
                    shortcuts - such as the ability to perform simultaneous editing (making the same interactive changes
                    to multiple selected areas) as well as quick navigation to files, symbols, and lines. And when you’re
                    spending 8+ hours with your editor each day, those precious few seconds saved for each process really
                    do add up…
                </p>

                <h3>2. Chrome Developer Tools</h3>
                <span>2</span>
                <p>
                    Wouldn’t it be great if you could edit your HTML and CSS in real-time, or debug your JavaScript, all while viewing a thorough
                    performance analysis of your website?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google’s built-in Chrome Developer Tools let you do just that. Bundled and available in both Chrome and Safari, they allow
                    developers access into the internals of their web application. On top of this, a palette of network tools
                    can help optimize your loading flows, while a timeline gives you a deeper understanding of what the browser
                    is doing at any given moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google release an update every six weeks – so check out their website as well as the Google Developers YouTube channel to
                    keep your skillset up-to date.

                <h3>3. jQuery</h3>
                <span>3</span>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has long been considered an essential front-end language by developers, although it’s not without its problems:
                    riddled with browser inconsistencies, its somewhat complicated and unapproachable syntax meant that functionality
                    often suffered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was until 2006, when jQuery – a fast, small, cross-platform JavaScript library aimed at simplifying the front-end process
                    – appeared on the scene. By abstracting a lot of the functionality usually left for developers to solve
                    on their own, jQuery allowed greater scope for creating animations, adding plug-ins, or even just navigating
                    documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And it’s clearly successful – jQuery was by far the most popular JavaScript library in existence in 2015, with installation
                    on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web.

                <h3>4. GitHub</h3>

                <p>
                    It’s every developer’s worst nightmare – you’re working on a new project feature and you screw up. Enter version control
                    systems (VCS) – and more specifically, GitHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By rolling out your project with the service, you can view any changes you’ve made or even go back to your previous state
                    (making pesky mistakes a thing of the past). The repository hosting service also boasts a rich open-source
                    development community (making collaboration between teams as easy as pie), as well as providing several
                    other components such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many employers will look for finely honed Git skills, so now’s the perfect time to sign up – plus it’s a great way to get
                    involved and learn from the best with a wide array of open-source projects to work on.

                <p>
                    Getting tired of typing in that same styling for a container? How about that button that keeps cropping up? Once you start
                    building front-end applications regularly, you’ll start to notice the same patterns emerging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UI frameworks are an attempt to solve these problems by abstracting the common elements into reusable modules - meaning developers
                    can scaffold the elements of new applications with speed and ease.

                <h3>6. Angular.js</h3>
                <span>6</span>
                <p>
                    HTML is usually the cornerstone of any front-end developer’s toolbox, but it has what many perceive to be a serious flaw:
                    it wasn’t designed to manage dynamic views.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where AngularJS, an open-source web application framework, comes in. Developed by Google, AngularJS lets you extend
                    your application’s HTML syntax, resulting in a more expressive, readable, and quick to develop environment
                    that could otherwise not have been built with HTML alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is not without its critics: some feel that this sort of data binding makes for a messy, non-separated code, but
                    we still think it’s an invaluable skill to have in your front-end kit.

                <h3>7. SASS</h3>
                <span>7</span>
                <p>
                    Web dev tools that save time are your best friend and one of the first things you’ll learn about code is that it needs to
                    be DRY (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”). The second thing you’ll probably learn is that CSS is usually not very
                    DRY.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter the world of the CSS preprocessor, a tool that will help you write maintainable, future-proof code, all while reducing
                    the amount of CSS you have to write (keeping it DRY).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps most popular among them is Sass, an eight-year-old open-source project which pretty much defined the genre of modern
                    CSS preprocessors. Although a little tricky to get to grips with initially, Sass’s combination of variables,
                    nesting, and mixins will render simple CSS when compiled, meaning your stylesheets will be more readable
                    and (most importantly) DRY.
