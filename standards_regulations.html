                        <h2>WCAG AND GOVERNMENT WEB STANDARDS IN CANADA</h2>
                        <p>

                            So, what is by definition this so-called Web accessibility standard? Let’s see … long story short: originally there was WCAG
                            which started out as a list of suggestions that barely anyone followed, but over time (2012)
                            it became an ISO standard having a more compelling basis for adoption. Now, per the ISO website
                            this is what it stands for:</p>

                        <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making
                            Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider
                            range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss,
                            learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity
                            and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more
                            usable to users in general. (Source)</p>

                        <img src="assets/img/visionweb_p2_standardsandregulations-assets/accessibility.jpg">

                        <p>
                            Currently WCAG 2.0 has 3 levels of compliance: A, AA, and AAA. In short, the higher they get the more demanding it becomes.
                            If for example we take a Guideline 1.4 that conveys that content must be distinguishable, then
                            the 3 levels of that rule will imply the following improvements:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Level A: color is not used as the only visual means of indicating actions, prompting responses
                                or distinguishing visual element</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Level AA : text and images of text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Level AAA: text and images of text must have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1
                            </li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Of course there are exceptions to these rules as clarified in the WCAG conformance requirements page: “It is not recommended
                            that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not
                            possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.” That said, the level of
                            conformance really depends on the audience, although the highest the broader since the highest
                            level includes the lowest.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thus, as stated, following WCAG is important because it gives content’s access to people with disabilities. Some sectors
                            of society (Government, Education, Health, Insurance, corporations engaged in social responsibility,
                            etc.) are compelled or in their best interest to deliver information and services to a wider
                            population range. Of course, this represents an additional effort for Web designers and developers
                            who must validate their work all along the production process with their choice from a vast array
                            of tools for that purpose.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Writing an article about Government standards comes handy since it’s precisely governments around the world who are trying
                            to comply more on this area than anybody else, since they must provide access to services to
                            their populations on a wider spectrum.
                        </p>

                        <h2>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</h2>
                        <p>
                            Given that the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat provides advice and makes recommendations to the Treasury Board committee
                            of ministers on how the government spends money on programs and services, how it regulates and
                            how it is managed. In this character, it provides access to all Treasury Board-approved policies
                            and related instruments for organizations across the Government of Canada. So, this government
                            agency oversees regulating the Web Accessibility Guidelines of the Canadian Government (see specific
                            links in the table at the end).
                        </p>

                        <p>Now, based on the resources found at the writing of this article, the Government of Canada largely
                            exceeds the provinces’ efforts. Not only does it follow numerous standards but they also have
                            an out-of-the-box ready to use framework that comply with such accessibility standards. </p>

                        <p>But how did they get to his point? Well, unfortunately our government got into the WCAG wagon long
                            ago through a lawsuit: Jodhan vs. Attorney General of Canada. So, in order to avoid disability
                            discrimination lawsuits, they got into developing their own open source framework for the Federal
                            Government use (and for everybody else, of course, being an open source project). The outcome
                            of that effort is the Web Experience Toolkit (WET), a quite impressive framework based on Bootstrap
                            with variants for Drupal, WordPress and more.
                        </p>

                        <p>Most, if not all, federal government websites comply with WCAG 2.0 AA thanks to the WET framework.</p>

                    <div class="container">
                        <h2>PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES</h2>
                        <p>
                            Most of the Canadian provinces websites comply with WCAG 2.0 AA or are in the progress of doing so. This province compliance
                            (or non-compliance) refers only to the province government’s website and not to its cities and
                            municipalities, which in most cases do not comply to the aforementioned level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, the Quebec Province even has its own Web standard name (based on WCAG at different levels).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            British Columbia, not only follows WCAG, but also has its own Content Management System although for instance Vancouver doesn’t
                            follow it. It only states that “The site is designed with consideration for people unable to
                            use a mouse” or that “to assist our visitors who are visually impaired or blind, our website
                            is compatible with a screen-reading software”.
                        </p>
                        <p>Ontario has its own policy for overall accessibility policy named Accessibility for Ontarians with
                            Disabilities Act (AODA) with Toronto, Ottawa, Kingston following, and loosely followed by smaller
                            municipalities at least on web-related matters.</p>
                        <p>For a more detailed outlook on all provinces let’s present this information on a table, although
                            please be advised that the table below reflects findings to the end of December 2016, so as time
                            passes links could reflect updates.</p>
