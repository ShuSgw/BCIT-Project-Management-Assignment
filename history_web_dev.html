                    <p>
                        The rise of the internet within mainstream culture is largely correlated with its history as a visual medium. Like many other
                        computer systems and applications, it took a graphic interface to get the general population to start
                        to understand the internet’s potential. The personal computer would not have proliferated throughout
                        our households and work environments without the display monitor, and still did not become widely
                        used until electronic spreadsheets, word processors and video games started attracting users. Similarly,
                        users did not start buying into the World Wide Webuntil the visual-oriented web browser started coming
                        into its own in the early 1990s. And since that time, even though there have been dramatic improvements
                        in web technology and aesthetics, some of the earliest web design techniques have persevered throughout
                        the years.

                    <h2>The Old Web</h2>

                    <p>
                        The idea of the internet had existed in some form for at least a half a century before it finally became a common household
                        utility in the 1990s. Conceived in the 1980s, the World Wide Web gained significant traction with
                        the introduction of the Mosaicbrowser in 1993. Shortly thereafter, businesses began recognizing the
                        web’s commercial potential, as network infrastructure grew to accommodate what would prove to be
                        a massive influx of online activity. Then the tech bubble grew and burst, the survivors of which
                        (Google, Amazon and the like) went from being key tech influencers to veritable corporate giants
                        within about a decade.</p>

                    <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee (then a fellow at the CERN Laboratory in Europe) outlined his concept of a computer
                        platform that could facilitate collaboration among researchers who are based in different parts of
                        the world. This led to the invention of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) in 1990. Strongly based
                        on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), HTML became the fundamental building block of
                        the World Wide Web, and remains at the core of its coding and infrastructure. The standard enabled
                        coders with the ability to organize web page layouts that could be understood and interacted with
                        over interconnected networks. (For more on the development of the web, see The 6 Programming Languages
                        That Built the Internet).</p>

                    <p>
                        The internet had long been around in some form by that point, with the first wide area network (WAN) having been established
                        in 1965 and the first local area network (LAN) around 1983. Twisted-pair, coaxial and fiber optic
                        cable had been in development for many decades, and had already been broadly applied in the field
                        of telecommunications. But when all of these technologies converged with Berners-Lee’s model, the
                        modern web was born. Interest in the technology quickly ramped up, and the first commercial web pages
                        were up and running by the mid-1990s.</p>

                    <p>Prior to the Mosaic browser, much of the web’s presentation consisted of text and tables. Although not
                        the first browser, Mosaic innovated the format by displaying text together with images in a way that
                        defined a path for the future of web design, and served as the World Wide Web’s killer app. Experiments
                        ensued in the form and function of web page elements. From menu hierarchies to fonts to color schemes,
                        web design grew into an art form that blended tech savvy with aesthetic sensitivity.</p>

                    <h2>The Turn of the Century</h2>

                    <p>
                        The web advanced a great deal in the years following the tech crash of 2000–2001. During this time, government started to
                        play an increasingly influential role in the web, while concurrently, strong tech companies emerged
                        from the ashes of the big collapse to set the new course for digital commerce and culture. And as
                        this newer and more solid foundation was laid, the internet increasingly became the main channel
                        for telecommunications in the modern age.</p>

                    <p>As hardware improvements cultivated broader networks and greater bandwidth, web development responded
                        by enabling designers with an array of multimedia to incorporate into the growing and diversifying
                        art of web presentation. Cascading Style Sheets afforded web design with new ways to organize and
                        display content. Flashvideo forged a new and entirely unique style of web art and animation, and
                        video streaming changed the way that people consume motion picture for good. Yet still, with all
                        of these revolutions and progressions in web development – the basic interface and structure of the
                        web page has maintained its integrity and balance of form and function. (For more on modern web development,

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since the advent of the Mosaic browser and the subsequent rise of the web interface, internet technology has thrived through
                        at least two major economic bubble bursts – in 2001 and in 2008. The latter collapse, while concurrent
                        with the larger housing crisis, also marked the age of a new killer app – the mobile operating system.
                        And in the years since then, the web page has gradually changed shape to accommodate its various
                        new contexts. Now, the mobile app could eventually even displace the web page as we know it. But
                        it still derives much of its basic properties from design concepts innovated through the discipline
                        of web development.
