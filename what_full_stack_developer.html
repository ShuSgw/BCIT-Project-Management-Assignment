                    <h1>What is Full stack developer?</h1>
                    <p>A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions
                        of an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see
                        or interact with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database
                        interactions, user authentication, server configuration, etc. Being a Full-Stack Developer doesn’t
                        mean that you have necessarily mastered everything required to work with the front-end or back-end,
                        but it means that you are able to work on both sides and understand what is going on when building
                        an application.

                    <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
                    <p>Almost every single program, whether online or in-person, that is teaching you how to be a web developer
                        will start with HTML and CSS because they are the building blocks of the web. Simply put, HTML allows
                        you to add content to a website and CSS is what allows you to style your content.</p>

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>The JavaScript language is growing more popular every year and new libraries, frameworks, and tools are
                        constantly being released. Based on the Stack Overflow 2016 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most
                        popular language in both Full-Stack, Front-end, and Back-end Development. It’s the only language
                        that runs natively in the browser, and can double up as a server-side language as well (as you’ll
                        see below with Node.js)</p>

                    <h3>Back-End Language</h3>
                    <p>Once you feel you’ve gotten a good grasp on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, you’ll want to move on to a back-end
                        language that will handle things like database operations, user authentication, and application logic.
                        All online programs and bootcamps usually focus on a specific back-end language, and in reality in
                        doesn’t matter which one you learn so much as long as you understand what is going on and you learn
                        the nuances of your chosen language. You’ll get a ton of different responses if you ask someone which
                        back-end language is the best to learn</p>

                    <h3>HTTP and REST</h3>
                    <p>HTTP is a stateless application protocol on the Internet —  it’s what allows clients to communicate with
                        servers (e.g. your JavaScript code can make an AJAX request to some back-end code you have running
                        on a server which will happen via HTTP).</p>
