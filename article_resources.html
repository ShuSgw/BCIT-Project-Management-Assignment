                <h3>1. A Comprehensive Guide to Web Design</h3>
                <span>1</span>
                <p>
                    Web design is tricky. One has to take a lot of things into account when designing a website, from visual appearance (how
                    the website looks) to functional design (how the website works). To simplify the task, we’ve prepared
                    this guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this article, we’ll focus on the main principles, heuristics, and approaches that will help you to create a great user
                    experience for your website. We’l start with the global things, like the user journey (how to define
                    the “skeleton” of the website) and then work down to the individual page (what should be considered during
                    web page design). We’ll also cover other essential aspects of design, such as mobile considerations and
                    testing. Read more from this article

                <h3>3. Create a Flexible Carousel Component</h3>
                <span>3</span>
                <p>
                    Vue.js has come on leaps and bounds recently, becoming the sixth most forked project so far on Github at the time of writing,
                    even ahead of Facebook’s own ReactJS. It’s safe to say that it’s fast becoming a mainstay in web development,
                    and a reliable go-to JavaScript framework for use in projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this tutorial, we’re going to be using Vue.js to create a simple carousel component. This component will accept a number
                    of different properties, enabling you to tweak some basic settings such as transition speed, transition
                    type, and whether the carousel should automatically transition slides. Read more from this article

                <h3>4. The future of web design is code-free</h3>
                <span>4</span>
                <p>
                    Coding does not solicit immediate feedback. It can take seconds, or much more, to verify the result of a single character
                    change. This latency cripples the creative process. Imagine daubing a canvas with a loaded paintbrush…
                    and seconds later the colour appears. How infuriating would that be? Inflicting on humans obvious violations
                    of the physical world is a recurring theme in technology, and I hope to see a big, black curtain fall
                    on it in the near future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if we could "code" without coding at all? What if that "code" could display instant hammer-to-nail visual feedback?
                    What if we could solve many of the problems in web design through a user interface mapped to a creative's
                    mental model? How many more people could join the fray and steer us toward a more beautiful and usable
                    web?

                <p>
                    With the popularity and advancements in web technology, it is imperative for every business to have a website and one which
                    is highly functional and visually attractive. The process through which a good website, mobile apps or
                    other similar platforms are created is known as web development. One of the most integral aspects of
                    web development is web programming that is achieved with the help of programming languages. Web development
                    languages are the platforms through which instructions are communicated to a machine and actions are
                    pursued.
