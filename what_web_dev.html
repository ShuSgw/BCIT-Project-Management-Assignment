                    <p>
                        Web Development is somewhat a vague term used to describe the building or maintaining of web sites hosted on the internet.
                        I use the word ‘vague' because there's so many programming languages, frameworks and tools that are
                        used for Web Development. Web Development could refer to a single web page built with HTML and CSS
                        that might contain a couple hundred lines of code. Or on the other end of the spectrum it could refer
                        to a website like Facebook that supposedly contains around 60 million lines of code, See reference:
                        How Many Lines of Code.

                    <h3>What is web Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Web development itself and how it is done has changed greatly over the years, but one thing has remained the same: web development
                        is about creating applications which run in a web browser. Some of those applications have most of
                        their logic living on a web server which renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other applications only utilize the server to create their initial state, download the logic to run the application, and
                        then use the server only to retrieve and store data. Regardless, though, of how web development is
                        done, the basic technologies are the same: HTML, JavaScript, CSS —and a large amount of patience.
                        Web developers today utilize about every major programming language to create web applications. To
                        name a few of the most popular web development languages in no particular order:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python (that includes Django, the Python web development framework)</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>ASP.NET</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>C</li>
                        <li>Scala</li>
                        <li>Ruby</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is possible because the user interface of a web application is essentially HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                        which can be generated by any programming language capable of generating text. JavaScript is used
                        to manipulate what is known as the DOM (Document Object Model), which is a representation of a webpage
                        in the browser, to directly change the user interface displayed in the browser without directly creating
                        new HTML or CSS code.</p>
