                        It's easy to get a little snobby about trends in creative disciplines. After all, there’s nothing creative or innovative
                        about keeping tabs on “what’s hot” — unless maybe you’re doing so just to continuously buck the trends.

                        sIn designers’ never ending quest for more creative and engaging layouts, the grid we’ve always relied on to bring harmony
                        and logic to our layouts has itself become a kind of constraint.

                        One of the more interesting challenges I’ve witnessed in the world of marketing digital products is that of image selection.
                        I’ve watched whole design teams mull over the debate, usually ending up in one of two places:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The former emphasizes the in-product experience, features, and functionality, while the latter tries to emphasize the product’s
                        human dimension: the effect it has on people’s lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The former emphasizes the in-product experience, features, and functionality, while the latter tries to emphasize the product’s
                        human dimension: the effect it has on people’s lives.
                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Why this is happening fascinates me, and I can’t decide exactly what it is. Perhaps it’s just the same cyclicality we’ve
                        long observed in the world of fashion — after all, illustration dominated the advertising world up
                        till the late 60s or so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or, maybe Dropbox’s design team was onto something with this explanation of their new illustration style:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We create rough sketches using graphite, then pair them with colorful, abstract shapes to bring the creative process to life.
                        Our style is inspired by the moment when you first have an idea, and serves as a reminder that the
                        “canvas is only blank until you make the first mark.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I mean … they had to be onto something with this redesign ... right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I mean … they had to be onto something with this redesign ... right?
                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Finally, it’s worth noting that illustrations can also neatly resolve some of the representational challenges posed by photography.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We build our digital products for a staggeringly diverse array of human beings — but the moment you capture a photo of a
                        real human being and pop that photo into your website’s hero, that human being personifies your user.
                        And leaves all other users unrepresented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, the human being illustrated in Shopify Polaris’ hero image is just a human being. Specifiers like race, gender,
                        nationality, and much more are left undefined, making it easier for any of us to project ourselves
                        into the role of that lone thinker, contemplating the creative possibilities illuminated by a guiding
                        light.

                    <h2>3. More organic and oblique shapes</h2>
                    <span>3</span>
                    <p>
                        Both web and mobile design have been dominated by card-based UIs for several years now. Until recently, most of those cards
                        were (mostly) sharp-edged and right-angled, exposing the geometry of their underlying divs in an
                        almost modernist concern for the materials of web design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s changed in a big, big way in 2017. Now, every app from Google Now to Twitter to Facebook boasts almost aggressively
                        rounded corners on their cards, input boxes, profile avatars, and more.
                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>
                        And it’s not just those primary elements growing more organic shapes. Backgrounds now abound with almost amoeboid blobs of
                        color, dramatic diagonals, even dashes of the real world rendered almost cartoonish.
                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>
                        But designers aren’t just turning to organic curves in their never-ending search for a way out of the box. Many simply give
                        those boxes a twist out of their usual 90° angles, freshening up their designs with a simple change
                        of perspective, as on Stripe’s homepage.
                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>
                        All this isn’t to say that right angles are going to go the way of the dinosaur. We’ve also seen several sites double-down
                        on straight lines — and mix them effectively with more organic and spherical shapes.
                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>
                        You’ll also notice the emergence of “flashing” or “vibrating” colors in many website UIs. While these color combinations
                        create incredibly striking effects — including ghostly afterimages that seem to linger in your eye
                        as you scroll on — it’s worth noting that they represent iffy territory from an accessibility perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While accessibility is usually thought of as making a design user-friendly for the disabled, it’s worth remembering that
                        even those with color vision can have a hard time with jarring color combos.
                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Designing and developing user interfaces that everyone, including people with disabilities, can independently consume and
                        interact with.
