                <h3>About Nicole</h3>
                <p>
                    Nicole is the User Interface/User Experience Designer for Vision Web. She’s dedicated to making your experience browsing
                    our website the best it can possibly be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From always being a creative and always loving technology, Nicole quickly found her place in the world of digital design.
                    Currently studying in BCIT’s New Media Design and Web Development program, she’s on the road to finding
                    her dream job as a UI/UX Designer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from design, Nicole loves being outdoors and exploring new places. She’s always on the hunt for a new hike to accomplish,
                    new city to check off her list, and new experience to try. As much as she loves adventuring - she’s also
                    happy to relax at home and curl up with a good movie.
