                        A responsive website is a single website that dynamically resizes its content and imagery for a variety of different screen
                        sizes in order to serve all users irrespective of the device they use the access the site. This is
                        an advancement to multiple versions of sites that used to be designed to support mobile devices.

                    <p>
                        A search engine is a website with a program that is dedicated to searching documents (i.e. web pages, which are HTML documents)
                        for specific keywords and returns the list of documents. A search engine has 2 parts: a spider and
                        an indexer. The spider is the program that fetches the documents, and the indexer reads the documents
                        and creates an index based on words or ideas contained in each document.
