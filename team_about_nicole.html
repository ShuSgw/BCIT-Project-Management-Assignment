                    <h3>About Nicole Ventura</h3>
                    <p>Nicole is an Interface/User Experience Designer. She’s dedicated to making your experience browsing our
                        website the best it can possibly be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From always being a creative and always loving technology, Nicole quickly found her place in the world of digital design.
                        Currently studying in BCIT’s New Media Design and Web Development program, she’s on the road to finding
                        her dream job as a UI/UX Designer!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from design, Nicole loves being outdoors and exploring new places. She’s always on the hunt for a new hike to accomplish,
                        new city to check off her list, and new experience to try. As much as she loves adventuring, she’s
                        also happy to relax at home and curl up with a good movie.
                    </p>
