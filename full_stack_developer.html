                    <h2>Sample Sample</h2>
                    <p>A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions
                        of an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see
                        or interact with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database
                        interactions, user authentication, server configuration, etc. Being a Full-Stack Developer doesnâ€™t
                        mean that you have necessarily mastered everything required to work with the front-end or back-end,
                        but it means that you are able to work on both sides and understand what is going on when building
                        an application.</p>
