                <p>Design is the process of collecting ideas, and aesthetically arranging and implementing them, guided by certain
                    principles for a specific purpose.
                </p>

                <h2>Sample Sample</h2>
                <p>A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of
                    an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see or interact
                    with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database interactions,
                    user authentication, server configuration, etc. Being a Full-Stack Developer doesnâ€™t mean that you have
                    necessarily mastered everything required to work with the front-end or back-end, but it means that you
                    are able to work on both sides and understand what is going on when building an application.</p>
