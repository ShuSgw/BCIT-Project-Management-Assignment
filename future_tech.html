                <h2>The future of web design</h2>
                <p>We ask web professionals: what lies ahead for the web design industry over the next 20 years?</p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        "The future, always so clear to me, had become like a black highway at night. We were in uncharted territory now, making
                        up history as we went along."
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus spoke Sarah Connor at the end of Terminator 2. But these prophetic words could just as easily apply to the state of
                    the web industry today.
                </p>
                <h3>The future of web apps</h3>
                <p>
                    With new techniques, technologies and movements constantly arriving on the scene, our sense of where things are going is
                    more uncertain than ever. And so we wanted to investigate what the landscape of web design might look
                    like in another 20 years or so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But don't expect to hear from self-styled 'futurists' and 'thought-leaders' who spend more of their working days giving TED
                    talks and writing Medium posts than actually sitting down and designing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, we've reached out to some professionals who are doing real-world work, to get a more grounded view of how they think
                    things might progress. Here's what they had to say…
                </p>
                <h2>Developer tools will change the game</h2>
                <p>
                    As we move towards the mid-21st century, it's indisputable that web design is going to become increasingly important. As
                    people live more and more of their lives online, digital user experiences will be the rock on which almost
                    every big organisation is built.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We want to act as a force multiplier, to help end the reinventing of the wheel across the industry," explains Frost. "There's
                    lots of infrastructure and all those types of things that goes into building software, and we want to
                    take that burden away from the product building teams."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sebastian Witalec, developer advocate for mobility developer relations at Progress, tells a similar story. Its open source
                    framework, NativeScript, enables you to build both desktop and mobile applications on a single codebase.
                    "Once you would have needed five different teams to do that, each with skills that are totally untransferable,"
                    he points out. "Now you can leverage the web skills you already have to do it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the trend for redefining how web systems are created is most obviously (and somewhat) controversially seen in the rise
                    of React and CSS in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "CSS in JavaScript is a big shift in how we design apps," says Haukur Páll Hallvarðsson, an engineer from Pusher. "It's stepping
                    away from the idea that HTML is content, CSS is how it looks and JavaScript is what it does." But he's
                    still fully in favour of it. "Focusing on building reusable components solves a lot of problems," he
                    argues. "I think it's good to change how we do things every now and then, to see if we can improve them."
                </p>
                <h2>Conversational interfaces</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how your users think and what they need is going to be key to knowing how to implement new technologies. And
                    that certainly applies to another major cultural shift on the web; towards conversational interfaces.
                    Because the biggest problems here won't be technical ones, they'll be human ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UX and design agency Sigma has been investigating the possibilities for some of its larger clients. "And a lot of the challenges
                    we've seen around conversational interfaces align very closely with the challenges around inclusive design:
                    mental models, language, confidence trust, and so on," reveals head of experience, Chris Bush.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His MD, Hilary Stephenson, points out that conversation interfaces fundamentally change the game in a way we haven't really
                    seen before in web design. "It's a big step moving away from a traditional screen-based interface, where
                    people can take their time to navigate around and look at supporting information, policies, terms and
                    conditions," she explains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When you've got a screen, you've got something that's giving you cues constantly and keeping you on track, but for conversational
                    interfaces, it's all in your head. That makes exploratory investigation much more difficult for people,"
                    she concludes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But many dangers are lurking, too: "AI and machine learning have more ground to cover in ethics, privacy and transparency
                    than they have in implementation," comments Stephenson. "The onset of the General Data Protection Regulation
                    (an EU directive that becomes enforceable in May 2018) will encourage privacy for design in the digital
                    community, where we really start to think about what we're asking people.
                </p>
                <h2>Web animation</h2>
                <p>
                    If chatbots take off, copywriting skills may become as important to the industry as visual design skills are right now. And
                    here's another creative skill that's going to be increasingly in demand: animation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, we once dismissed UI animations as tacky, annoying and obtrusive. But recently they've made a comeback, as a useful
                    way to provide instant feedback when a user takes an action and to guide them through a process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why the turnaround? Tommy Mason, web designer at creative marketing agency CAB Studios, credits Google's Material Design
                    and other animation frameworks for raising standards. "Without that, people weren't looking at the small
                    intricacies like the timing, how fast it was coming in, going out, so all these movements that were happening
                    on the screen looked very unnatural," he says.
                </p>
                <h2>VR and AR</h2>
                <p>
                    Another skillset that's increasingly in demand by web design studios is 3D. That's most obviously the case when it comes
                    to virtual reality - something Matthew Claypotch, developer advocate at Mozilla, believes is going to
                    be a very big deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And don't discount augmented reality (AR) either. It may have taken a while, but with the arrival of Apple's ARKit and Google's
                    ARCore, things are progressing fast. Sebastian Witalec of Progress envisages a world in which the web
                    will become part of our day-to-day vision.
